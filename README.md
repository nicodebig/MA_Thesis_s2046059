# RESPONSible Service: Evaluating Communication Styles in LLM-Generated Customer Service Interactions

This repository accompanies the thesis **"RESPONSible Service: Evaluating Communication Styles in LLM-Generated Customer Service Interactions"** by Nicolò de Bigontina, conducted at Leiden University. The project investigates how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, express and differentiate between four key communication styles in customer service: **clarity, friendliness, empathy, and politeness**.

## 📝 Thesis Overview

The study presents the **RESPONSible Service** dataset, a synthetic collection of 4,000 customer service interactions generated by GPT-4o. Each interaction is labeled and written according to one of four predefined communication styles. The study includes:

- A description of the **generation methodology** used to create the RESPONSible Service dataset.
- A detailed **linguistic analysis**, examining features such as cohesion, sentiment, verb tense usage, formality, and concreteness.
- An assessment of **model performance** on text generation tasks using in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization, all applied to the RESPONSible Service dataset.
- An **evaluation** of the generated outputs using BERTScore, ROUGE-L, and human agreement ratings.

Key findings include:
- Higher human agreement for friendliness, empathy, and politeness subsets than for clarity.
- Moderate alignment between the language patterns found in the generated data and the ones found in effective human customer service communication, with some occasional deviations.
- In-context learning outperformed other training methods in generating and preserving stylistic markedness in customer service responses.

## 📊 Usage

To explore or reproduce the analysis:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsible-service.git
   cd responsible-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook THESIS_CODE.ipynb
   ```

## 📂 Dataset: RESPONSible Service

Each `.parquet` file contains 1,000 customer service interactions focusing on one communication style. Each item has three fields:

- `request`: Customer query.
- `response0`: Initial LLM-generated customer service reply reflecting the target style.
- `response1`: A more stylistically marked version of `response0`.

## 📄 License and Ethics

- All data were **synthetically generated** using GPT-4o.
- The generated data are in English.
- No real customer data were used.
- The project complies with ethical standards for computational linguistics research.
